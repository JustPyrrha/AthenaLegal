# Athena Privacy Policy

The developers of Athena are not lawyers and do not have the resources to hire lawyers.
We have, to the best of our ability, written this document clearly, concisely, and accurately.
If you have any questions, please see the [Contact and Data Access and Removal](#contact-and-data-access-and-removal) section.

## Collected data
Currently, Athena does not collect any data, but this will change in the future with the release of several planned features.

## Contact and Data Access and Removal
For questions, and access and/or removal of personal data, you may email us at [contact@pyrrha.gay](mailto:contact@pyrrha.gay).
